## Basic Teleop

In this example the predefined actions of SMARTS are used, so the control of the car is not absolute and it is very difficult to leave the road (although it does not prevent you from colliding with other cars).

## Velocities Teleop

In this other example, linear and angular velocities are used for braking, throtling and steering. The control of the car is much greater and you can drive off the road, but the problem is that the control is still not absolute. In addition, a PID was added to avoid ‘skidding’.
