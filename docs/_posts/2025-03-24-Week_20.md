## Test model

Training plot:

![](plots_dqn/p_v2_final.png)

A programme has been created that simulates the programme 100 times and calculates an approximate average success rate. Each time the manoeuvre is successfully performed, the episode is terminated.

After several tests it has been determined that the trained model has a reliability between 80-90%, 33 random positions/orientations are used.
