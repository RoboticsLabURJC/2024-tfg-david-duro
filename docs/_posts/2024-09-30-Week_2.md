## Starting to go backwards

The main problem with this phase is that the simulator is designed to drive exclusively forwards, in fact, the reward system is based on the time and distance you drive forwards.

`DirectController()` class has been used for the movement, which allows us to choose with more ‘freedom’ the pair of v and w for our vehicle.

The problem with this class is that to make it more realistic you can't choose the linear speed of the vehicle, but you control the linear acceleration. In the first tests and using negative values, I didn't see any change in its direction, until I found the speed value and after a little testing, I could see perfectly how the vehicle decelerates and then manages to go backwards.


Within the control class we have an scenario for each chassis, in our case we have used the chassis box, in which we have simply added a debugg line.

```python
if isinstance(chassis, BoxChassis):
    # Since BoxChassis does not use pybullet for force-to-motion computations (only collision detection),
    # we have to update the position and other state here (instead of pybullet.stepSimulation()).
    heading_vec = radians_to_vec(vehicle.heading)
    dpos = heading_vec * vehicle.speed * dt
    # Debugging outputs
    new_pose = Pose(
        position=vehicle.position + np.append(dpos, 0.0),
        orientation=fast_quaternion_from_angle(target_heading),
    )
    target_speed = vehicle.speed + acceleration * dt
    # Debugging
    print(f"Target Speed: {target_speed}")
    vehicle.control(new_pose, target_speed, dt)

elif isinstance(chassis, AckermannChassis):
    # code ...

else:
    raise Exception("unsupported chassis type")
```
